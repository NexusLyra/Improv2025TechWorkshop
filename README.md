# Installation
Firstly this assumes you have Python already setup (the code was written with 3.12)

It is also recommended that you setup [a virtual environment](https://www.w3schools.com/python/python_virtualenv.asp) for the project

Next you will have to download a model [from VOSK](https://alphacephei.com/vosk/models)
Once you have it downloaded, extract it then change line 50 to the path to the folder

`model = vosk.Model(r"<PATH TO FOLDER>")`

Then you should be able to run main and it should go to the default microphone
